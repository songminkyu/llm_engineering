# Mksong Community Contribution

This folder contains the community contribution by **Mksong** for week 3 of the LLM Engineering course.

## Contents

- Implementation examples for LLM engineering tasks
- Experiment results and documentation
- Code samples and explanations
- Any additional notes or references related to the assignment

## How to Use

1. Review the provided code and documentation.
2. Run any example scripts as described in the comments or additional documentation.
3. Refer to the experiment results for insights into model performance or engineering strategies.

## Dependency Installation

Before running any code, make sure to install the required dependencies.

### Using `requirements.txt` (if provided)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual Installation

If there is no `requirements.txt` file, refer to the code comments or documentation for the list of required Python packages. You can install them using pip, for example:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the actual package names used in the code.

> **Tip:** Use a virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv venv`) to manage dependencies for this project separately.
